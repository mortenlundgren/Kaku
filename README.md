## 🚀 What is Kaku?

Kaku is a terminal application built for people who want to work with AI-related coding efficiently. It runs on macOS and uses Rust to ensure speed and reliability. It supports serial connections and provides a modern terminal experience.

### Why Kaku?

- **Fast startup:** Kaku opens quickly so you can start coding right away.
- **Built for AI coding:** It has features that support AI programming workflows.
- **Simple interface:** Easy to use, even if you don’t know much about terminals.
- **Reliable:** Developed using Rust, known for its performance and safety.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before downloading Kaku, make sure your computer meets these requirements:

- **Operating System:** macOS 10.15 (Catalina) or later.
- **Processor:** Intel or Apple Silicon (M1, M2) chips.

2. Look for the latest release; it will have a version number like “v1.0” or higher.

3. Download the file that matches your Mac:
   - Usually, it will end in `.dmg` or `.zip`.
   - Choose the Apple Silicon version if you have an M1 or M2 Mac.
   - Choose the Intel version if you have an older Intel-based Mac.

4. After the download is complete, open the file:
   - If it is a `.dmg`, double-click to open the installer window.
   - If it is a `.zip`, unzip it first by double-clicking, then open the extracted file.

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to move Kaku into your Applications folder.

6. Once installed, open the Applications folder and double-click Kaku to launch it.

## 🛠️ First Time Setup

When you start Kaku for the first time, you will see a welcome screen with some basic settings.

- **Theme:** Choose a light or dark theme that suits your eyes.
- **Font size:** Pick a font size that is comfortable to read.
- **AI features:** You can toggle specific AI coding helpers on or off. These assist with auto-completion and quick commands.

Take your time adjusting these. You can always change them later in the settings menu.

## 🔌 Connecting to Serial Devices

Kaku supports serial connections, useful if you work with hardware like Arduino or Raspberry Pi.

To connect:

1. Plug your device into the Mac via USB.
2. In Kaku, open the menu and select “Connect to Serial Device.”
3. Choose the correct serial port from the list.
4. Set the baud rate (try 9600 if unsure).
5. Click “Connect.”

You should now see data from your device in the terminal window.

## 🔍 Basic Usage Tips

- **Opening multiple tabs:** Use Command + T to open a new tab.
- **Switching tabs:** Use Command + Number keys (e.g., Command + 1 for first tab).
- **Copy and paste:** Use Command + C and Command + V as usual.
- **Clear screen:** Press Command + K.
- **Search:** Press Command + F to search inside the terminal output.

Practice these shortcuts for faster navigation.
